<p>Nightbugs wriggle and glow when exposed to the energy of your nexus. Gather nightbugs near your nexus to store additional energy.</p>
<p>Your nightbugs store up to {{unit.effect[0].calcStats().capMult | percent:{places:2, plusOne:true} }} more maximum energy. Hatching more has diminishing returns, but can increase this to a maximum of {{unit.effect[0].val | percent:{plusOne:true} }}.</p>
